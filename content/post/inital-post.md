# Initial Post

This is the initial post to make sure that everything is going to be hosted
correctly. It may perhaps be beneficial to discuss what is planned.

We hope to write up tutorials for different things on the command line,
interesting tools, and solutions to problems we have found in the wild. In
particular we hope to shed some light on things we had difficulty on and to
further our understanding in the process.
